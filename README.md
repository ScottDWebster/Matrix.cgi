# Matrix.cgi
Creates a random matrix, then inverts it step by step.

I wrote this as an assignment for a college class in the late 1990's or so.  We were supposed to write something in C, but I wrote it in Perl instead.  This can be run either on the command line or as a cgi script on a web server.

The file MatrixSampleOutput.txt is provided as example output.
